Create an application with 2 "pages"

    - I should be able to click a tab and go back and forth between each page
    - Color and theme should match, but the elements on each page should be disctinct


Page 1.
    Should have a section that explains how to read and write Morse Code
    
    There should be a section where a user can type in plain english and see their text translated into morse code
     (these could be a separate pages, drop downs, what have you)


One page will be a "tutorial and practice" page




Page 2.
    This page will be for testing the user and their skill in translating FROM Morse Code into English
    
    There should be a "start" button on this page that starts the "quiz", afterward Morse Code will start to appear one word at a time. 
    
    The user will type out the translation for the Morse Code and submit it, if it is correct they receive a point, and a new word appears
    
    Continue this process until the timer reaches zero


STRETCH GOALS:
    Record the users score, but replace it if and ONLY IF they recieve a higher score
    Instead of hardcoded JSON for a list of words, take a list of words from an already existing source (ask for recommendations for Kaggle/API if you are lost)
    Store the users score, ask their name, and send and prepare a POST request to store that to allow for "High Scores" to be tracked after the window is reset


Hint: hint Javascript Math for timer may be necessary
